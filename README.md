## Arduino Game Design

Inspired by the uber sucessful app "Flappy Bird," the goal of the game design was to create a simplified version of this. Ultimately it ressembled something closer to the app "Crossy Road." The project was a final assignment for a digital electronics lab. 

A more detailed report of the design including a wriring diagram of the hardware can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fRVG6EUUIis-7vC6_ehjJnuHm0IX1Heu/view?usp=sharing).

A video of the game play is available on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/emP_VaV-6Og).
